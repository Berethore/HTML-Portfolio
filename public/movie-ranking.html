  <h1>The best movies I watched lately</h1>

<h2> You can find my favorites below!</h2>
<hr>
<h3> Cruella</h3><br>
<p> It's a good story revealing the other side of the coin "101 dalmations"</p>
<h3> Malificent</h3><br>
<p> Another coin flip to the sleeping beauty fascinating tale, giving a good idea why the protagonist became the evil one there</p>
<h3> Frozen</h3><br>
<p> A little tragic of a cursed little girl that caused a family member's death, requiring to keep her at bay later on until something strange happens.</p>
